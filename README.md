## Overview üß†
Traditional deep learning models encode knowledge within their parameters, limiting transparency and adaptability to data changes. This poses challenges for addressing user data privacy concerns. To overcome this limitation, we propose to store embeddings of the training data independently of the model weights. This enables dynamic data modifications without retraining. Our approach integrates the k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) classifier with a vision-based foundation model pre-trained on natural images in a self-supervised manner. This integration enhances interpretability and adaptability while addressing privacy concerns.

Figure 1: During pretraining 1), the image encoder is trained to extract representative features. The knowledge-storing phase 2) utilizes the pre-trained (now frozen) encoder to extract and store task-relevant knowledge from the training data. During inference 3), that knowledge allows the classification of query images through majority voting on the top-k similar embeddings.

- Open-source implementation including a previously unpublished baseline method and performance-improving contributions
- Integration of k-NN classifier with recent vision-based foundation models
- Flexible data storage system for dynamic data modifications without retraining
- Evaluation of method's performance across established benchmark datasets and medical image classification tasks
- Assessment of method's robustness in continual learning and data removal scenarios
